# MeArm v0.4 Robotic Arm

The MeArm v0.4 is a 3D-printed robotic arm that I developed and built from scratch. This project combines mechanical design, 3D printing, electronics, and embedded programming to create a functional robotic manipulator.

## Overview

This project involved designing, printing, and programming a MeArm v0.4 robotic arm. The arm is controlled by an ESP8266 NodeMCU microcontroller and programmed using Lua scripting language.

## Technical Specifications

- **Microcontroller**: ESP8266 NodeMCU
- **Programming Language**: Lua
- **Construction**: 3D-printed components
- **Degrees of Freedom**: 4-axis movement
- **Control Method**: WiFi-enabled remote control

## Key Features

- **3D Printed Design**: All mechanical components were 3D printed for cost-effectiveness and customization
- **WiFi Control**: Remote control capabilities through ESP8266's built-in WiFi
- **Servo Motors**: Precise control using servo motors for each joint
- **Open Source**: Based on the open-source MeArm design with custom modifications

## Development Process

1. **Design Phase**: Modified the original MeArm design for better performance
2. **3D Printing**: Printed all mechanical components using PLA filament
3. **Assembly**: Assembled the mechanical structure with servo motors
4. **Programming**: Developed Lua scripts for movement control and WiFi communication
5. **Testing**: Calibrated and tested all movements and control systems

## Learning Outcomes

This project provided hands-on experience with:
- 3D printing and mechanical design
- Embedded systems programming
- Servo motor control
- WiFi communication protocols
- Robotics and kinematics

## Future Improvements

- Integration with computer vision for autonomous operation
- More sophisticated control algorithms
- Mobile app development for easier control
- Addition of sensors for feedback control
